  Hello,
  <br/>
  <br/>

  I currently work at BenchPrep, an online test prep company that provides students with courses across iOS and Android devices, as well as the web. I am responsible for the front-end development, UX and UI of most of BenchPrep's web content. Feel free to browse the <a href="https://benchprep.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">public website</a> and Benchprep's <a href="https://benchprep.com/gre/test/what-is-the-gre" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">structured test articles</a>.  Both are entirely responsive, and tested in IE8+.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cheers,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Erik Schneider

  <h1 class="title">Full-Length Tests</h1>
</header>
<p>
  Most recently I implemented our new UI around taking a full-length test.  This experience must allow a user to see all questions within a section of a test, and skip between them freely. When they are finished, they must review their answers and submit them before moving on to the next section of the test.

  The BenchPrep study plan is a list of assignments split up in to a subset of weeks leading up to the users desired completion date.

  <h1 class="title">Lessons</h1>
</header>
<p>
  The lessons view allows users to jump through all of the course's content in one section. Users are onboarded to mark their confidence with each piece of content, providing both us and them with valuable information about their strengths and weaknesses.  The content column is capped at a reasonable width so the line length doesn't become to long and unreadable.

<p>
  The BenchPrep account management section is 100% resonsive (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://benchprep.com">along with the entire marketing site</a>) and compiles all of the users preferences and account information in to one place.
